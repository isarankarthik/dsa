Sorting is an important technique which is used to make the elements of the array either in the ascending or in the descending order. 
We have some of the techniques in order to sort the array 
1. Insertion Sort : 
  This sorts the elements in the array by inserting the element into the correct position.
  For example if there are 6 elements, and then now we comapre the first two elements, then the first three elements, then the first four elements and so on. 
2. Selection Sort : 
  This sorting techniqque works on the principle by selecting the smallest element in the each iteration and then placing it in its position.
3. Bubble sort :
   This compares each element and then moves the largest element to the end of the array in the each iteration.
